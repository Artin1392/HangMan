# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple implementation of the classic word-guessing game in Java. Players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts.

## Features

- Interactive console-based gameplay
- Randomly selected words from a predefined list
- Tracks the number of incorrect guesses
- Displays the current state of the word and guessed letters

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Artin1392/HangMan.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd HangMan 
   ``` 

3. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac HangMan.java
   ``` 

4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   java HangMan
   ```



### How to Play
The game will randomly select a word from the list.
You will be prompted to guess a letter.
If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed; if not, you will lose a life.
The game continues until you either guess the word or run out of lives.
